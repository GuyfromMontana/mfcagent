}Reconciled serverless architecture with existing Express setup.Perfect! The user's existing package.json already has @supabase/supabase-js which is what we need. It also has Express and other dependencies that they're using for their existing dashboard.
Since we're deploying to Vercel as serverless functions (not an Express server), we need to merge these carefully. The API functions I created are Vercel serverless functions, not Express routes.
Actually, looking at this, the user has an Express server setup. We have two options:

Keep using Express and convert my serverless functions to Express routes
Keep both - use Express for the dashboard, and Vercel serverless for the API functions

I think the cleanest approach is to keep the existing package.json since it already has @supabase/supabase-js. The user can just copy the other files (api folder, vercel.json, etc.) and skip the package.json since theirs already has what's needed.
Let me create a merged package.json that keeps their existing setup but adds anything needed for the serverless functions.Good news! Your package.json already has @supabase/supabase-js which is what we need!
Here's your merged package.json:
